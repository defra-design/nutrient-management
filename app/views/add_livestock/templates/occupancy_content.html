<p class="govuk-body strong">Occupancy</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
    These animals are counted by the number of places for them on the farm. Occupancy means the proportion of the year that these places are occupied by animals. 
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
    For example, if your production cycle lasts 42 days, and the empty period is 7 days (total 49 days), then your occupancy is 86%.
    If the occupancy on your farm is different to the value shown here, you can change it.

    Nitrogen (N) standard

<p class="govuk-body">
  The nitrogen (N) standard figure is the average nitrogen (N) produced by this type of animal
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  This figure accounts for occupancy already, so if you change it, you must keep the occupancy value the same. You can only change one of these values.
